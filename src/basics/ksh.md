# ksh, the Korn shell

[`ksh`], or the Korn shell, is the default shell in OpenBSD. It is used in rc
scripts as well as many other places. You are free to change your shell, of
course, but knowing the basics of [`ksh`] will help you understand OpenBSD
better.

*Note*: I ran into an [interesting
quirk](https://hrpr.us/blog/interesting-ksh-quirk/) when I set the `EDITOR`
environment variable while using [`ksh`].
